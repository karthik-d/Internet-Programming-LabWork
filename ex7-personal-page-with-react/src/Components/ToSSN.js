                    I spent a substantial part of my student life at Bangalore, where I had the chance to experience
                    diverse cultures from across the country. As that helped me shape my character and establish an
                    academic foundation and character, I soon realized my interest in Mathematics and Computers.

                    I joined SSN in 2019 to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering,
                    In an attempt to expand my horizons in the field whilst eventually discovering my specific
                    interests, I have thus far spent three quality years at SSN taking diverse courses and exploring
                    multiple
                    avenues.
